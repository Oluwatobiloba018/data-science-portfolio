# 🧪 Zindi – Excellent Store Challenge

This project was developed for a Zindi competition where the goal was to predict the number of item returns per store.

## 🧩 Problem
Using historical transaction and item data, predict returns using regression models.

## ⚙️ Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model comparison (XGBoost, LightGBM, Ridge)
- Stacking ensemble model for final prediction

## 📊 Evaluation
- Metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Final RMSE: *[Insert best RMSE here]*

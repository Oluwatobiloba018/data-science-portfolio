# ðŸ§  Blood Pressure Prediction Using CNN & LSTM

This project explores deep learning techniques to predict systolic and diastolic blood pressure from images of digital monitor screens.

## ðŸ©º Problem Statement
Manual documentation of blood pressure readings is error-prone. This system automates the process using image recognition and prediction models.

## ðŸ“‚ Workflow
- Image acquisition from BP monitor screens
- Image preprocessing using OpenCV
- Label extraction (systolic/diastolic)
- Model training using:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Model evaluation using MAE/RMSE

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python, OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ”— Results
CNN outperformed LSTM in image feature extraction, but LSTM offered temporal benefits for sequen
